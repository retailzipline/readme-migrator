  <li>Inventory adjustments are used anytime a one off product needs to be added or removed from your store inventory. Do not use inventory adjustments for Replenishments or purchases, those use a different method.</li>
  <li>You may need to make inventory adjustments if items arrive with damage, items are lost or stolen, or when products are used for display merchandising and at events. Adjustments are also made to add in products from un-opened sellable returns and in the event that a customer switches from in-store fulfillment to parcel or IHSD.</li>
