# README.io Migration Tool

README.io is a documentation tool that some companies use to create internal docs. This tool is intended to support migrating those docs to Retail Zipline's Resource Library.

2. Run ./bin/convert_to_html PATH_TO_EXTRACTED_EXPORT
3. TBD
4. Profit!

## Development

The script is intentionally simple in basic ruby. The tricky bits are tested using minitest. Please keep test coverage high.
